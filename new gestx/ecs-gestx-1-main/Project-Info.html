    <h1>Working Model</h1>
    <h3>First the camera module will take the input of the face and reads the face emotion when the speech starts, with the help of the ML model it will detect the facial expression and give the output for every particular periodic time.</h3>
    <h3>That output will be taken into the list and for every few seconds the list will take the percentage of the each emotion which was shown by the speaker, here the emotion which are going to be detected are happiness,neutral,confused,fear.</h3>
    <h3>After getting the percentage of the each emotion the percentage will be shown visually through the smart mirror so the speaker will come to know how the speech went so far and based on the percentage of the emotion the suggestion will be given to the speaker on how to alter the speech and emotion to the correct way.</h3>
    <h3>he suggestion will be given to the speaker for every 30 sec so speaker will concentrate on the speech rather the suggestion which might be disturbing if given for every few seconds</h3>
